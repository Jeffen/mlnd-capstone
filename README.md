# mlnd-capstone
Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree capstone project

## Introduction
For detail information of this project, please have a look at `report.pdf` and `Machine_Learning_Capstone_Reports.ipynb`

## Project Setups
- Open `Machine_Learning_Capstone_Reports.ipynb` with Jupyter notebook and run through all the blocks in the file. If you are the first time running this project. Please run `convert()` function in the first block. That will convert all the files in Keras CIFAR-100 dataset to 244*244 pixels jpeg files. You can skip this step afterwards.
- Because of the storage limits, I cannot include trained weight in this repository.
- For model detail information, please have a look at `inception.py` and `mobilenet_model.py`
